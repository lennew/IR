The gaur (/\xc9\xa1a\xca\x8a\xc9\x99r/, Bos gaurus), also called the Indian bison, is the largest extant bovine native to the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. Population decline in parts of its range is likely to be more than 70% during the last three generations. However, population trends are stable in well-protected areas, and are rebuilding in a few areas which previously had been neglected.[1]The gaur is the tallest of wild cattle species.[2]The Malayan gaur is called seladang, and the Burmese gaur is called pyoung \xe1\x80\x95\xe1\x80\xbc\xe1\x80\xb1\xe1\x80\xac\xe1\x80\x84\xe1\x80\xba.[3] The domesticated form of the gaur is called gayal (Bos frontalis) or mithun.[4]
