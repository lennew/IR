The taxonomical genus Pan (often referred to as chimpanzees or chimps) consists of two extant species: the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. Together with humans, gorillas, and orangutans they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes). Native to sub-Saharan Africa, common chimpanzees and bonobos are currently both found in the Congo jungle, while only the common chimpanzee is also found further north in West Africa. The two species are on the IUCN "red list" of critically endangered species and in 2017 the Convention on Migratory Species, which was held in The Philippines, selected the common chimpanzee for special protection.[2]
