see Species.Seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is the name given to 54 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek word hippos (\xe1\xbc\xb5\xcf\x80\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, h\xc3\xadppos) meaning "horse" and kampos (\xce\xba\xce\xac\xce\xbc\xcf\x80\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, k\xc3\xa1mpos) meaning "sea monster".[3] Having a head and neck suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.[4]
