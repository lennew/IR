A raven is one of several larger-bodied species of the genus Corvus. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus.There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens.The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven.
