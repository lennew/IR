The vicu\xc3\xb1a (Vicugna vicugna) or vicugna[2] (both /v\xc9\xaa\xcb\x88ku\xcb\x90nj\xc9\x99/) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicu\xc3\xb1as produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicu\xc3\xb1a\'s wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicu\xc3\xb1as highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicu\xc3\xb1a garments; today the vicu\xc3\xb1a is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms.Both under the rule of the Inca and today, vicu\xc3\xb1as have been protected by law, but they were heavily hunted in the intervening period. At the time they were declared endangered in 1974, only about 6,000 animals were left. Today, the vicu\xc3\xb1a population has recovered to about 350,000,[1] and although conservation organizations have reduced its level of threat classification, they still call for active conservation programs to protect populations from poaching, habitat loss, and other threats.Until recently, the vicu\xc3\xb1a was thought to not have been domesticated, and the llama and the alpaca were both regarded as descendants of the closely related guanaco. But recent DNA research has shown the alpaca may well have vicu\xc3\xb1a parentage.[3] Today, the vicu\xc3\xb1a is mainly wild, but the local people still perform special rituals with these creatures, including a fertility rite.
