The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), a camelid native to South America, stands between 1.0 and 1.2 m (3 ft 3 in and 3 ft 11 in) at the shoulder[2] and weighs 90 to 140 kg (200 to 310 lb).[3] Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears.The name guanaco comes from the South American Quechua word huanaco[4] (modern spelling: wanaku). Young guanacos are called chulengos.[5]
