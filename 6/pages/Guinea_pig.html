The domestic guinea pig or simply guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea in Africa. They originated in the Andes of South America; studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C. tschudii, and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild.[1][2]The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.[3] Guinea pigs are a culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where they are known as cuy. Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[4]In Western societies, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; and the relative ease of caring for them continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures are cultivated by breeders.Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet "guinea pig" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.
