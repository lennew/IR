Chinchillas are two species of crepuscular rodents, slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrels. They are native to the Andes mountains in South America[3] and live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). Historically, chinchillas lived in an area that included parts of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, and Chile, but today colonies in the wild are known only in Chile.[4] Along with their relatives, viscachas, they make up the family Chinchillidae.The chinchilla has the second-densest fur of any land mammal, exceeded only by the sea otter[5] and is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who once wore its dense, velvet-like fur.[6] By the end of the 19th century, chinchillas had become quite rare due to hunting for their ultra-soft fur.[7] Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised.[8]
