A gnat /\xcb\x88n\xc3\xa6t/ is any of many species of tiny flying insects in the dipterid suborder Nematocera, especially those in the families Mycetophilidae, Anisopodidae and Sciaridae.[1] They can be both biting and non-biting. Most often they fly in large numbers, called clouds. "Gnat" is a loose descriptive category rather than a phylogenetic or other technical term, so there is no scientific consensus on what constitutes a gnat.University of Kentucky entomologists consider only non-biting flies to be gnats,[citation needed] while the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the University of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x93Lincoln classify fungus gnats in addition to non-biting flies as gnats.[citation needed] Certain universities also distinguish eye gnats: the Smithsonian Institution describes them as \xe2\x80\x9cnon-biting flies, no bigger than a few grains of salt, ... attracted to fluids secreted by your eyes\xe2\x80\x9d.[citation needed]
