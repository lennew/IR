Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting "tail" (abdomen) (Greek: \xce\xb2\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xcf\x87\xcf\x8d\xcf\x82, translit.Â brachys = short,[2] \xce\xbf\xe1\xbd\x90\xcf\x81\xce\xac / \xce\xbfura = tail[3]), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. They live in all the world\'s oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws. Many other animals with similar names \xe2\x80\x93 such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs, and crab lice \xe2\x80\x93 are not true crabs.
