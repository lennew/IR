Magpies are birds of the Corvidae (crow) family, including the black and white Eurasian magpie, which is widely considered one of the most intelligent animals in the world,[1][2][3] and one of the only nonmammal species able to recognize itself in a mirror test[4] (though a recent study suggests that giant manta rays can also recognize their own reflections[5]). In addition to other members of the genus Pica, corvids considered as magpies are in the genera Cissa.Magpies of the genus Pica are generally found in temperate regions of Europe, Asia and western North America, with populations also present in Tibet and high elevation areas of India, i.e. Ladakh (Kargil and Leh) and Pakistan. Magpies of the genus Cyanopica are found in East Asia and also the Iberian peninsula. Birds called magpies but not actually related may be found in Australia.
