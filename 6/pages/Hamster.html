Hamsters are rodents (order Rodentia) belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae, which contains about 25 species classified in six or seven genera.[1] They have become established as popular small house pets,[2] and because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as laboratory animals.In the wild, hamsters are more crepuscular than nocturnal and remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing insects.[3] They have elongated cheek pouches extending to their shoulders, using them to carry food back to their burrows.
