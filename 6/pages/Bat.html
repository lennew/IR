Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera[a] whose forelimbs form webbed wings; they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, using their very long spread-out digits which are covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti\'s hog-nosed bat, which is 29\xe2\x80\x9334 mm (1.14\xe2\x80\x931.34 in) in length, 15 cm (5.91 in) across the wings and 2\xe2\x80\x932.6 g (0.07\xe2\x80\x930.09 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, which can weigh 1.6 kg (4 lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).The second largest order of mammals, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. However, more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats being members of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bat species are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; the vampire bats feed on blood. Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators. Bats are present throughout most of the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They are important in their ecosystems as major pollinators of flowers and for dispersing fruit seeds; many tropical plant species depend entirely on bats for the distribution of their seeds.Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser. Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides. They are natural reservoirs of many pathogens, such as rabies; since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread diseases. They are sometimes numerous enough to serve as tourist attractions, and are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim. In many cultures, bats are popularly associated with darkness, death, witchcraft and malevolence.
