Quetzal (/k\xc9\x9bts\xcb\x88\xc9\x91\xcb\x90l/ or /\xcb\x88k\xc9\x9bts\xc9\x99l/) are strikingly colored birds in the trogon family.They are found in forests, especially in humid highlands, with the five species from the genus Pharomachrus being exclusively Neotropical, while a single species, Euptilotis neoxenus, is found in Mexico and very locally in southern United States.[1] They are fairly large (all over 32 cm or 13 inches long), slightly bigger than other trogon species.[2][3]Quetzals have iridescent green or golden-green wing coverts, back, chest and head, with a red belly. They are strongly sexually dimorphic, and parts of the females\' plumage are brown or grey. These largely solitary birds feed on fruits, berries, insects and small vertebrates (such as frogs).[2][3] Even with their famous bright plumage, they can be hard to see in their natural wooded habitats.
