Tonight’s itinerary
Why transport matters

Active travel

Public transport

Ways forward





I am not trying to develop tonight some overarching dynamic model of transport innovation and adoption over time. That’s well beyond the scope of tonight’s presentation. But I am seeking to tease out what is innovation, who brings it about in the transport sphere, what has happened in Brisbane and Queensland over time, and what this might mean as we look over the horizon at the future.

Why transport matters










Co-benefits of 
investment in physical activity 
Increased social capital
Fitter kids
Better learners
Reduced congestion
Increased productivity
Reduced absenteeism





Cleaner air




Improved 
road safety



Better health
Reduced
disease burden

                    Active and 
             independent ageing


Liveable streets


Reduced financial costs



Transport matters for business
We recently surveyed 40 restaurateurs versus 300 customers
How do customers get there?
Who spends more money?


(Ghafoor, Yen & Burke, 2015)









The death and life of active travel



1960s – the car was the future…

House and street design changed

Cul-de-sacs

But walking and cycling                         are fighting back…

“Investment in Active 
Transport Survey”
Heart Foundation & Cycling Promotion Fund (2015)



Who is riding bikes?
The survey involved 1,006 Australians aged 25 to 59. 
Cyclists were more likely to be:
Men
Higher income earners
Recreational riders (“exercise or for fun”) more so than commuters

What about children: 
the iMATCH and CATCH projects
Burke, Curtis, Duncan, Whitzman, Tranter (2009-2014)
Focus on children’s independent mobility



Just a small part of our findings
Australian children crave independent travel

Parental desires to give ‘licenses’ to their children for this seem to have risen in recent years

(Significantly higher rates than found in past Australian studies)



But!
Neighbourhood factors prevent many children from getting this independence
Traffic danger
Fears of stranger danger
Trip distances



Brisbane’s Active School Travel and 
Queensland’s Healthy Active School Travel programs
World-leading programs
Use gamification
Adaptive on-the-ground solutions




SEQ Household Travel Surveys 
clear shifts in active travel to school




21st Century public transport



21st Century Light-Rail
Currie & Burke (2013)
Melbourne: 
Slowest operating speed world-wide; Ave. stop spacing 279m
Gold Coast: 
99% segregated right-of-way; Ave. stop spacing 812m
Exceeding patronage forecasts




Bus priority works too…
Brisbane’s busways (est.2000)
Laterally and grade separated bus-only corridors


http://shoroc.com/much-learnt-for-northern-beaches-brt-from-brisbane-busway-site-visit/


Brisbane’s Busways
Superior operating performance to most world BRT systems

(Tanko & Burke 2013; 2014)

Source: http://cotteeparker.com.au/project/south-east-busway/



Better bus networks are effective
20% patronage gain for new Gold Coast network
2nd level innovations like Melbourne’s Smart Bus 




Public transport & city building
Burke & Sipe (2011, 2013)
Tanko, Burke, Soltani, et al (Forthcoming)
Brisbane’s City-Cats (est.1996)
A linear (not cross-river) service
Higher-speed/ frequency




Brisbane ferry terminals                        and property values

(Tsai, Mulley, Yen & Burke 2014)


Key rail and busway systems are at or approaching theoretical capacity
Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane rail
Brisbane SE Busway




The car is changing too
More electrified
More autonomous
More collectivised
Less km travelled (‘Peak Car’)
