The Making of Creative Energy –  „Enerģija un Pasaule” (Energy and the World)! 
 
<strong>JURIS EKMANIS, president of the Latvian Academy of  Sciences</strong> 
 
In ten years „Enerģija un  Pasaule” has established itself amongst popular science publications, which can  be only envied as very few have managed to achieve it. Practically there are  only two this kind of magazines in Latvia – “Zvaigžņotā Debess”, which has been  circulated for fifty years now and has a well established and specific niche,  and the five times younger “Enerģija un Pasaule”. 
 
Many magazines, which generally  write on multiple topics, have written about power industry, but none have made  energy their topic of interest; our competitive advantage. We are grateful that  Juris Savickis, the chairperson of the editorial board and the patron of the  Honour, has helped the magazine’s publishers maintain sponsorship. This is a  very hard work to do and Juris Savickis with his skills has helped us a lot. To  my mind the main objective is to broaden the readers range, firstly in  Lithuania, Russia and Ukraine, translating the magazine firstly Russian and  later on in English. 
 
The power industry is one of the  Europe’s priorities and finally someone has started to think about it in Latvia  as well. Questions concerning energy power are not a local matter, but a basis  of the world’s economics. They consolidate countries, continents and will never  be a label that will extinct that becomes outdated. The interest in the power  energy will only increase and so it is a great satisfaction that this magazine  can foresee the future developments in the energy world, for instance, giving  its readers the latest information regarding the nuclear energy, the events in  our country and the world. I truly wish for the “Enerģija un Pasaule” to begin a  discussion about the atomic energy (nuclear energy) and its role in Latvia. The  discussions that the magazine has organized so far are not only popular amongst  specialists but also in the society and the media. 
 
I wish to all the creators of  this magazine not only the energy in its title but also when developing it. Keep  the creative spirit and furthermore success. Subsequent support from Juris  Savickis is definitely assured to this visually and informatively valuable  magazine and its creators.
