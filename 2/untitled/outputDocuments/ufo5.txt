the Ibrtland Office has advised that Leaveritt u. Richards, aviation *�=eMaa___

editor of the "Oregonian,"�has stated that Captain William Lgdbavidson
and Lieutenant Frank HiXBrown of the Fourth AAF Headquarters, San Francisco,
were in Portland on Ju y 27, 19h?. While in Ihrtland they interviewed Dick

�92la�ankin, an experienced pilot, who had reported that he observed, on June lh,

/

a fonnation of ten flying discs over Bakersfield, California. Richards added
that Davidson and Brown had also interviewed the following four experienced

"pilots who were among the first to report seeing discs, Kennethi�rnold, bnsi
irom Boise, Idaho; Captain E. J?§Smith, a co-pilot; Ralph§Stevens, United Ai
and DaveRJohnson, aviation editor, Idaho"Statesnan." In order to determine

nessnan
rlines
the

purpose of tiese interviews Richards contacted Hajor General Twining of&#39;$right Field
Ohio, and from him gained the impression that the AAF instituted this investigation_
to wash out the disc_reports since they are definitely not of AAF origin.

On Friday, August l, the plane in which AAF investigators, Captain �
Davidson and Lieutenant Brown, were flying, crashed at Kelso, Washington and both
were killed. The wreckage was screened by RAF Intelligence from McChord Field.
The "Tacoma News Tribune" and through them toe United Press put out a story that
the plane was carrying parts of a disc which had struck a boat wned by Farold
Dahl and Fred Chrisman. It has also been inferred that this plane was sabotaged

to prevent these disc parts from being examined.

ST {BEE

Investigation by the Bureau has reflected that this plane was defi
not carrying parts of a disc and there appears to be no substantiation of a

charge.

_ For your further information there is attached a blind memorandum
forth in more detail the results of the investigation surrounding the above
crash. No further inquiry is being made in this matter.

greens who were alleged to have seen flying discs.

sscmuwr MATTER  x92  -.

Reference is made to

Dean
examination has been

determined to be of

Boston teletype to the Bureau dated July 18, 1947.

the original informant, has advised that a spcctographic
completed of the metal particles referred to. They were

ordinary cast iron which had been subjected to a very £6
high degree cf heat, The heat caused scales to be formed on the cast iron Vai
which were originally thought to be of some metallic alloy.

The scientist examining the particles concluded that if they had come through
the air from any great altitude in as small pieces as they were found then
most of the heat would have been taken from them by the time they reached

the ground and fires would not have resulted, It is noted they landed l
approximately 700 feet from a railroad track and inquiries were conducted by
MET to determine whether or not the particles could have been originally a
part of a liner in a smoke stack or some other part of the steam engine. These
inquiries resulted in positive information that the particles did not come from
a train or locomotive. Measurements cf the four pieces examined revealed
that they had most likely been originally all part of one hollow cylinder,
eight inches in diameter and three sixteenth: of an inch in thickness. It
was felt that one piece falling from a great height would have still retained
a good part of its heat and probably would have smashed when it hit the ground.

A scientist, whom _did not identify by name, recalled that cast
~ iron cylinders of similar measurements had been used in New Mexico on

research work on a guided missile project. However, this unidentified scie
did not so conclude to the exclusion of all other possibilities.

f�nkrv ==W"&#39;
� I is interesting to note that the examination at HIT was actually conducted
1; �who furnished the Boston Office with an informal report similaré S2:

Kb 92in all major details to that supplied by_above. The men at BIT en�
are gathering through friends all additional pieces of the original cylindet"- . t
available. These will be turned over to the �cston Office. No further,� -;�
examination is being conducted by MIT and no effort is �being mad?/�

It is noted that the original Boston teletype reflected that this inquiry
was being treated as "secret" matter at MIT. �has advised that
the comparatively small number oi� research scientfsts at LET during the summer
are all cognizant of the incident and the results of the research. However,
no publicity has been given and it is not anticipated that any will result. £6 ykf
The 5ureau&#39;s interest is not known to the scientists at MIT. There has been
no speculation that a guided missile originating in a foreign land landed
in New Hampshire,

As indicated above, unless the Bureau requests specifically further investigative
action, this case is being closed in the Boston Office-

who ens subsequently taken to a local hospital. At 0610 ?3T an attempt
ins node to telephone Sq. B at HAHILICH FIELD but no answer was received;
however, it was known that HAHILIOH AFS was aware of the incident and
would notify Sq. B. At 070a PST Capt. LITTRELL departed in e C-45 for
KHLSO. At 0746 PST Sq B res contacted by phone and given a flush report.
At 0905 PST CAPT LITTPELL phoned and informed that he hnd placed CLP?AIH
PGRJBERG in charge of Army personnel proceeding to the scene of the crash.
80 aerial search was necessary as civilians in the area knew tho exact

location or the crash and had reported finding one �! body in the wreckage.
CAPT. LJTTRELL prepared to fly Sgt&#39;s TAP? and ¥ATH3n3 to HCGHOR9 FIELD
for nedionl attention, arriving at 0945 P37. The survivors stated that
they believed neither the pilot nor cc-pilot has pereohuted Iron the
plane. The osuse of the incident was at this time determined to be a fire
in the left engine. CAPT *gTTR2LL was infcrneo ey 5;t. IAFF that he
believed classified documents had boon aboard the plane; C$FT F3?3BLEG
was instructed to take necessary precautions. An ambulance moi tic plane
at HCCHQBD F1¬LD carrying the two survivors and took than to the hospital.
Inteagpgstion revealed that the left engine had caught fire in the power
section and flcmcs and smoke had spread to the flight deck almost inmedq
lately. The ore: chief, KAIHEGS, assisted TA?F in attaching his chest
pac; and TLHF abandoned the plane at an estimated altitude of 10,300 ft
 this fact is doubted but ls not considered necessarily relevant}.

sennel had been nearing the harness! and as he left the plane one annrc that
the on-pilot was preparing to follow. The pilot had started Lo leave and,
to th92 beet recollection of PATBERS, was partially standing and holding
the odhtrol wheel with his left hand. 2ATnEb&#39;S statenents indicate that

proper energenoy procedures had been performed but that the flares had en-
veloped the entire left side almost iancdiately. TiPF stated that, because
of the full noon and good visibility, he sow UATHEKS leave the plane and
ens able to follow the plane to the ground and that he sow no one else

before hitting the ground snore it exploded and burned about one �! mile
from where he, IAFF, landed. �e lit in a tree, and not knowing how to
release his parachute of the quick-detachable kind, cut himself loose from
the harness with his pocket knife. he kicked and struggled and eventually
jumped to the ground, receiving a jolt on impact but as unable to guess
hoe for he had fallen. He then fclloeod a cow path for an estimated two

�! miles to a fern house, arriving erter HATHRRS. Ecanuhile, as NATSHBS
cleared the plenu he turned and see the plane strike the ground, explode
and burn. Just before or just at the tine of impact he sew an object
atire thrown clear of the plane but did not know whether it was n person
or pert of the plene. HAIHLAS also lit in a tree, and after freeing himself
from his harness, fell to the ground where he injured his back. �e lost
consciousness and on recovering went to the burning plane, about fifty

from another planet.  4&#39; 1

The Los Angeles Office was re� uested to locate and

5U3JBCT= FLYING_QISCS AND SAUCERS
MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING -

For the Breau&#39;s information, several citizens in the community of

Alexandria, Louisiana, have recently reportedly seen flying discs. The Alexan-
dria, Louisiana daily paper has carried numerous articles concerning this.

At a recent meeting of the Young Hens Bsiness Club in Alexandria,
a member suggested that since Alexandria, Louisiana is known as a convention city,
the club should try promoting a convention of flying saucer sears. This particu-
lar comment appeared in the Alexandria paper and was picked up by the AP lines.

ur. a member of the Young Hens Bsiness Club, advised
Special Agent that since the AP release, they have received alarge number of requests regarding the convention of flying saucer sears from mar!
parts of the United States. l£r.�states that the interest of the people
is evidenced by their inquiries about convention particulars, stating they are
flying saucer seers and want to attend such a convention.

76

"This gentleman further advised that in view of the volume of inquiries
coming in, it appears that the YHBC will have to hire an employee to handle all
the correspondence. It might be noted that he advised a representative of the
Air Force from Barksdale Field, Louisiana, has inquired as to plans of a flying
saucer conventio, stating that they are interested in furnishing an observer if
such a convention were held. -I

This information is being furnished the Bureau, as it is possible such
an enterprise may cause people to falsify that they have seen flying discs or fly-
ing saucers. Such falsifications might be made so that they might attend such a
convention or become official delegates thereto.
