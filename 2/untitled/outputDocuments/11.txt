Background
Together with BIC and APTIA, we developed the Bus and Coach Health and Wellbeing Study to assist the industry in understanding the current landscape of Driver health and wellbeing in an industry faced with common workforce issues such as bullying and harassment and an aging staff demographic. 

International research tells us that if employers consider how they can build a healthy workplace, not simply because of Work Health & Safety laws, but because it makes good economic and social sense, that it ultimately delivers benefits to everyone.

 An industry ‘first’ – why we did this

A day in the life of a bus driver
We worked with our case study, Forest Coach Lines, to identify the environmental, physical, cognitive and psychological demands of their drivers. 
We then used this experience to measure the impact that these demands have on an individual Driver’s health and wellbeing.
Following this was the introduction of a series of tailored health and wellbeing initiatives to Forest Coach Lines Drivers of which the results could be measured.

 What we did next 
Bully and Harassment Training 
96% participation rate – positive response from staff 
Employee Assistance Services
24 hour confidential telephone counselling service
Onsite access to Chiropractors 
Workplace injury management and prevention 
Visible nutritional and dietary guidance
Fresh fruit bowl (100% awareness from staff) and ‘health noticeboard’ 
Exercise programs
Staff tracked their daily step count using pedometers – this encouraged them to be more active throughout the day to increase their count.

The Results
Strong evidence that tailored health and wellbeing solutions positively influence Driver productivity, health and wellbeing. 

Key results from Forest Coach Lines’ participation in the Study include: 
Almost all study participants (96%) completed the Interact Group’s bullying and harassment training with 96% of participants indicating that they had not experienced bullying or harassment since the trials (these figures have shown a positive improvement since an initial survey was undertaken by Interact in 2012).
80% of participants indicated a positive relationship with their Supervisor or Manager and 15% indicated average relationship (these figures have shown a positive improvement since an initial survey was undertaken by Interact in 2012).
69% of Study Participants were aware of company policies designed to improve health and wellbeing. 
100% of Study Participants were aware of the availability of a fresh fruit bowl to encourage healthy diet choices. 
62% of participants were aware of free 24/7 confidential telephone counselling service




Conclusion
Driving a healthy, strong and productive workforce of the future. 

The aim of the Bus and Coach Health and Wellbeing Study is to act as a preliminary piece for the industry to ensure continued and improved productivity whilst improving employee health and wellbeing.
