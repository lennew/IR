The most enjoyable 102 minutes you’ll ever encounter in a cinema, Singin’ In The Rain is dazzling in its perfection: from the innocent exuberance of Kelly, O’Connor and Reynolds, to the clutch of great songs (Make ‘Em Laugh, You Are My Lucky Star and the immortal title tune), from the stunningly simple staging of the dance numbers to the wit of the screenplay, the story of silent movie stars adapting to the sound era is shot through with a cleverness and sophistication rare for the genre.

With so many films dedicated to the agonies of filmmaking, Singin’ overflows with the pleasure of movie creation, stitching together references to Hollywood history with more alacrity than Tarantino. One of the highpoints of hoofin’ history but, more importantly, an unadulterated joy.
