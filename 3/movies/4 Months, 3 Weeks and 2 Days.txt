Drama about a black market abortion in Communist Romania. (1:53) Unrated: language, nudity, disturbing images. At IFC Center, Lincoln Plaza. In Romanian with subtitles.

This year’s foreign language Oscar scandal – there is always at least one – is the snub of director Cristian Mungiu’s disturbing, masterful realist drama following two college roommates as they carry out plans for one’s black market abortion in Communist Romania. Winner of last year’s Gold Palm at Cannes, "4 Months" paints a stark portrait of social repression in the last days of rule by Nicolai Ceauºescu.

"4 Months" centers on Otilia (Anamaria Marinca), a stoic tech student from a working class family who goes to heroic lengths to protect her pregnant, virtually helpless and generally ungrateful roommate Gabita (Laura Vasiliu). The day’s events, which include an awkward time-out for Otilia with her boyfriend’s patronizing family and dealing with an abortionist (Vlad Ivanov) who demands sex from both women before doing his job, makes this a true horror story.

Gabita may remind everyone of a person they’ve known while Otilia is the friend everyone should have.
